# TypeScript-task
## Description:
This is a small task in TypeScript which was provided as technical testing for recruitment purposes. The following instructions on how to run the app are provided for ***Windows*** users.
## How to run it locally:
* Clone repository locally
* Run command prompt
* CD to the repository
* Run by command `npm run start`
## Code structure:
Even though it was not defined, the application presents a first level of abstraction by using interfaces. The function modifying the main object has its own file and the main index file is used only for calling said function.
The structure can be further improved by dividing the function purposes in subsets depending on the purpose. This is so to show some object-oriented thinking rather than a strict implementation of OOP with classes.
## Considerations:
This was my first ever task made in TypeScript. I have programmed in JavaScript, Java and only recently tapping into React and Python. Nonetheless, the challenge was a much needed brain exercise. I am sure the following code
probably has some simpler and more maintainable or readable variations, but considering this is only my first approach I am quite happy with the result.
I hope this can also show the level of commitment and interest in learning new things.
